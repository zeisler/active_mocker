## Description
ActiveMocker creates mock classes from ActiveRecord models, allowing your test suite to run at breakneck speed. This can be done by not loading Rails or hitting a database. The models are read dynamically and statically so that ActiveMocker can generate a Ruby file to require within a test. The mock file can be run by itself and comes with a partial implementation of ActiveRecord. Attributes and associations can be used the same as in ActiveRecord. Methods have the same argument signature but raise a NotImplementedError when called, allowing you to stub it with a mocking framework, like RSpec. Mocks are regenerated when the schema is modified so your mocks won't go stale, preventing the case where your units tests pass but production code fails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'active_mocker'
end
```
It needs to be in development as well as test because development is where mocks will be generated.
And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_mocker

## Dependencies
* Tested with Rails 4.1, 4.2, 5.0
* Requires Ruby MRI >= 2.1.x


## Setup


  See [example_rails_app](https://github.com/zeisler/active_mocker/tree/master/example_rails_app) for complete setup.


### Generate Mocks

Running this rake task builds/rebuilds the mocks. It will be ran automatically after every schema modification. If the model changes this rake task needs to be called manually. You could add a file watcher for when your models change and have it run the rake task.

    rake active_mocker:build

## Usage
```ruby
#db/schema.rb

ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20140327205359) do

  create_table "people", force: true do |t|
    t.integer  "account_id"
    t.string   "first_name",        limit: 128
    t.string   "last_name",         limit: 128
    t.string   "address",           limit: 200
    t.string   "city",              limit: 100
  end

end
```
--------------
```ruby
#app/models/person.rb

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :account

  def self.bar(name, type=nil)
	puts name
  end

end
 ```
----------------- 
  
### Using With Rspec, --tag active_mocker:true

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require 'active_mocker/rspec_helper'
require 'spec/mocks/person_mock'
require 'spec/mocks/account_mock'

describe 'Example', active_mocker:true do

  before do
	Person.create # stubbed for PersonMock.create
  end

end
```       
----------

* Assigning the tag `active_mocker:true` will stub any ActiveRecord model Constants for Mock classes in an `it` or a `before/after(:each)`. This removes any need for dependency injection. Write tests and code like you would normally.
* To stub any Constants in `before(:all)`, `after(:all)` use `active_mocker.find('ClassName')`.
* Mock state will be cleaned up for you in an `after(:all)`. To clean state your self use `active_mocker.delete_all`.

---------
    
```ruby
Person.column_names
  => ["id", "account_id", "first_name", "last_name", "address", "city"]

person = Person.new( first_name:  "Dustin", 
    				 last_name:   "Zeisler", 
    				 account:      Account.new )
  => "#<PersonMock id: nil, account_id: nil, first_name: "Dustin", last_name: "Zeisler", address: nil, city: nil>"

person.first_name
  => "Dustin"
```

### When schema.rb changes, the mock fails
(After `rake db:migrate` is called the mocks will be regenerated.)

```ruby
#db/schema.rb

ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20140327205359) do

  create_table "people", force: true do |t|
    t.integer  "account_id"
    t.string   "f_name",        limit: 128
    t.string   "l_name",        limit: 128
    t.string   "address",       limit: 200
    t.string   "city",          limit: 100
  end

end
```
--------------

```ruby
Person.new(first_name: "Dustin", last_name: "Zeisler")
  =>#<UnknownAttributeError unknown attribute: first_name >
```

### Creating Custom collections

If you want to create custom set of record that is not part of the global collection for model. (ie. for stubbing in a test)

```ruby
User::ScopeRelation.new([User.new, User.new])
```

This give the full query API (ie. find_by, where, etc). 

This is not feature available in ActiveRecord as such do not include this where you intend to swap in ActiveRecord.


## Optional Features

Use theses defaults if you are starting fresh

```ruby
ActiveMocker::LoadedMocks.features.enable(:timestamps)
ActiveMocker::LoadedMocks.features.enable(:delete_all_before_example)
ActiveMocker::LoadedMocks.features.enable(:stub_active_record_exceptions)
```

### timestamps

  Enables created_at and updated_at to be update on save and create

### delete_all_before_example

  When using "active_mocker/rspec_helper" it delete all records from all mocks before each example.

### stub_active_record_exceptions

  When requiring "active_mocker/rspec_helper", and adding `active_mocker: true` to the describe metadata, these errors will be auto stubbed:
  
  * ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  * ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique
  * ActiveRecord::UnknownAttributeError
    
### Copy over Mock safe methods into the generated mock
  
  Adding the comment `ActiveMocker.safe_methods` at the top of a class marks it as safe to copy to the mock.
  Be careful that it does not contain anything that ActiveMocker cannot run.
  
  ```ruby
  # ActiveMocker.safe_methods(scopes: [], instance_methods: [:full_name], class_methods: [])
  class User
    def full_name
      "#{first_name} + #{last_name}"
    end
  end
  ```

## Mocking Methods

#### Rspec 3 Mocks - verify double
Verifying doubles are a stricter alternative to normal doubles that provide guarantees about
what is being verified. When using verifying doubles, RSpec will check that the methods
being stubbed are actually present on the underlying object if it is available.
[rspec-mocks/docs/verifying-doubles](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs/verifying-doubles)
```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.mock_framework = :rspec
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
    mocks.verify_doubled_constant_names = true
    mocks.verify_partial_doubles = true
  end
end
```

```ruby
Person.bar('baz')
  => NotImplementedError: ::bar is not Implemented for Class :PersonMock. To continue stub the method.

allow(Person).to receive(:bar) do |name, type=nil|
  "Now implemented with #{name} and #{type}"
end

Person.bar('foo', 'type')
=> "Now implemented with foo and type"
```

#### When the model changes, the mock fails
(Requires a regeneration of the mocks files.)

```ruby
#app/models/person.rb

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :account

  def self.bar(name)
    puts name
  end

end
```

--------------
```ruby
Person.bar('foo', 'type')
  => ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)
```
----------------
```ruby
#app/models/person.rb

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :account

  def self.foo(name, type=nil)
    puts name
  end

end
 ```   
--------------
```ruby
allow(Person).to receive(:bar) do |name, type=nil|
  "Now implemented with #{name} and #{type}"
end
=> RSpec::Mocks::MockExpectationError: PersonMock does not implement: bar
 ```     
### Constants and Modules

* Any locally defined modules will not be included or extended. It can be disabled by `ActiveMocker::Config.disable_modules_and_constants = true`

---------------
```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  CONSTANT_VALUE = 13
end
```
-----------------------
```ruby
PersonMock::CONSTANT_VALUE
  => 13
```

### Scoped Methods 
* Any chained scoped methods will be available when the mock file that defines it is required. When called it raises a `NotImplementedError`, stub the method with a value to continue.

### Managing Mocks  

```ruby    
require "active_mocker/rspec_helper"

active_mocker.delete_all # Delete all records from loaded mocks

active_mocker.find("User") # Find a mock by model name. Useful in before(:all)/after(:all) where automatic constant stubbing is unavailable.

active_mocker.mocks.except("User").delete_all # Delete all loaded mock expect the User mock.

```

### Schema/Migration Option Support
* A db/schema.rb is not required.
* All schema types are supported and coerced by [Virtus](https://github.com/solnic/virtus). If coercion fails the passed value will be retained.
* Default value is supported.
* Scale and Precision are not supported.

### Known Limitations
* Namespaced modules are not currently supported.
* When an association is set in one object it may not always be reflective in other objects, especially when it is a non standard/custom association. See [test_rails_4_app/spec/active_record_compatible_api.rb](https://github.com/zeisler/active_mocker/blob/master/test_rails_4_app/spec/active_record_compatible_api.rb) for a complete list of supported associations. 
* Validation/Callbacks are not supported.
* Sql queries, joins, etc will never be supported.
* A record that has been created and then is modified will persist changes without calling `#save`, beware of this difference.
* This is not a full replacement for ActiveRecord.
* Primary key will always default to `id`. If this is an causes a problem open an issue.
