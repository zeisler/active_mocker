ActiveMocker creates mocks classes from ActiveRecord models. Allowing your test suite to run very fast by not loading Rails or hooking to a database. It parses the schema.rb and the defined methods on a model then generates a ruby file that can be included within a test. The mock file can be run by themselves and come with a partial implementation of ActiveRecord. Attributes and associations can be used just the same as in ActiveRecord. Methods will have the correct arguments but raise an Unimplemented error when called. Mocks are regenerated when the schema is modified so your mocks will not go stale; preventing the case where your units tests pass but production code fails.

## Installation

Add this line to the test group in your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'active_mocker', :group => :test

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_mocker

## Dependencies
* Tested with Rails 4.1 may work with older versions but not supported.
* Requires Ruby MRI =< 2.1.


## Setup


  See [example_rails_app](https://github.com/zeisler/active_mocker/tree/master/example_rails_app) for complete setup.


### Generate Mocks

Running this rake task builds/rebuilds the mocks. It will be ran automatically after every schema modification. If the model changes this rake task needs to be called manually. You could add a file watcher for when your models change and have it run the rake task.

    rake active_mocker:build

## Usage
```ruby
#db/schema.rb

ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20140327205359) do

  create_table "people", force: true do |t|
    t.integer  "account_id"
    t.string   "first_name",        limit: 128
    t.string   "last_name",         limit: 128
    t.string   "address",           limit: 200
    t.string   "city",              limit: 100
  end

end
```
--------------
```ruby
#app/models/person.rb

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :account

  def bar(name, type=nil)
	puts name
  end

  def self.bar
  end

end
 ```
----------------- 
  
### Using With Rspec, --tag active_mocker:true

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require 'active_mocker/rspec_helper'
require 'spec/mocks/person_mock'
require 'spec/mocks/account_mock'

describe 'Example', active_mocker:true do

  before do
	Person.create # stubbed for PersonMock.create
  end

end
```       
----------

* Assigning the tag `active_mocker:true` will stub any ActiveRecord model Constants for Mock classes in `it` or `before/after(:each)`. This removes any need for dependency injection. Write tests and code like you would normally.
* To stub any Constants in `before(:all)`, `after(:all)` use `mock_class('ClassName')`.
* Will call `ActiveMocker::LoadedMocks.delete_all` in `after(:all)` block to clean up mock state for other tests.

---------
    
```ruby
Person.column_names
  => ["id", "account_id", "first_name", "last_name", "address", "city"]

person = Person.new( first_name:  "Dustin", 
    				 last_name:   "Zeisler", 
    				 account:      Account.new )
  => "#<PersonMock id: nil, account_id: nil, first_name: "Dustin", last_name: "Zeisler", address: nil, city: nil>"

person.first_name
  => "Dustin"
```

### When schema.rb changes, the mock fails
(After `rake db:migrate` is called the mocks will be regenerated.)

```ruby
#db/schema.rb

ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20140327205359) do

  create_table "people", force: true do |t|
    t.integer  "account_id"
    t.string   "f_name",        limit: 128
    t.string   "l_name",        limit: 128
    t.string   "address",       limit: 200
    t.string   "city",          limit: 100
  end

end
```
--------------

```ruby
Person.new(first_name: "Dustin", last_name: "Zeisler")
  =>#<UnknownAttributeError unknown attribute: first_name >
```

## Mocking Methods


### Class Methods

```ruby
Person.bar('baz')
  => RuntimeError : :: bar is not Implemented for Class :PersonMock

# Rspec 3 Mocks

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.mock_framework = :rspec
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
    mocks.verify_doubled_constant_names = true
    mocks.verify_partial_doubles = true
  end
end

allow(Person).to receive(:bar) do |name, type=nil|
  "Now implemented with #{name} and #{type}"
end

Person.bar('foo', 'type')
=> "Now implemented with foo and type"

# Rspec 3 mock class method
allow_any_instance_of(Person).to receive(:bar) do
  "Now implemented"
end
```

#### When the model changes, the mock fails
(Requires a regeneration of the mocks files.)

```ruby
#app/models/person.rb

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :account

  def bar(name)
    puts name
  end

end
```

--------------
```ruby
Person.new.bar('foo', 'type')
  => ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)
```
----------------
```ruby
#app/models/person.rb

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :account

  def foo(name, type=nil)
    puts name
  end

end
 ```   
--------------
```ruby
# Rspec 3 Mocks
allow(person).to receive(:bar) do |name, type=nil|
  "Now implemented with #{name} and #{type}"
end
=> NoMethodError : undefined method `bar' for class ` PersonMock '
 ```     
### Constants and Modules are Available.

* Any locally defined modules will not be included or extended.

---------------
```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  CONSTANT_VALUE = 13
end
```
-----------------------
```ruby
PersonMock::CONSTANT_VALUE
  => 13
```

### Scoped Methods 
* As long the mock file that holds the scope method is required it will be available but raise an `unimplemented error` when called.

### Managing Mocks  

Deletes All Records for Loaded Mocks - (Useful in after(:each) to clean up state between examples)
```ruby    
ActiveMocker::LoadedMocks.delete_all
```
### ActiveRecord supported methods

### Schema/Migration Option Support
* All schema types are supported and coerced by [Virtus](https://github.com/solnic/virtus). If coercion fails the passed value will be retained.
* Default value is supported.
* Scale and Precision are not supported.

### Known Limitations
* Model names and table names must follow the default ActiveRecord naming pattern.
* Whatever associations are setup in one mock object will not be reflected in any other objects. 
    * There's partial support for it to work more like ActiveRecord in v1.6 when `ActiveMocker::Mock.config.experimental = true` is set. When v1.7 comes out these features will be moved out of experimantal.

* Validation/Callbacks are not present in mocks. A Work around is putting the method into a module with required ActiveSupport/ActiveModel dependencies and make sure the code is supported by the mock. 
* Sql queries, joins, etc will never be supported.
