  spec.description   = "ActiveMocker creates mock classes from ActiveRecord models, allowing your test suite to run at breakneck speed. This can be done by not loading Rails or hitting a database. The models are read dynamically and statically so that ActiveMocker can generate a Ruby file to require within a test. The mock file can be run by itself and comes with a partial implementation of ActiveRecord. Attributes and associations can be used the same as in ActiveRecord. Methods have the same argument signature but raise a NotImplementedError when called, allowing you to stub it with a mocking framework, like RSpec. Mocks are regenerated when the schema is modified so your mocks won't go stale, preventing the case where your units tests pass but production code fails."
